      <h2>What is KroFly?</h2>
      <p>KroFly is a minimalist compass-style app that points you toward your target destination. Whether you want to know what direction your destination, home or your favourite place is, anywhere anytime.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How does KroFly work?</h2>
      <p>You set a target based on its Longitude and Latitude, KroFly then uses your phones GPS and sensors to find your location relative to your target to point the way.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Does KroFly work offline?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Once a destination is saved, KroFly works fully offline using your device's compass and location sensors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is my location data stored?</h2>
      <p>No, I do not handle any of your data. KroFly only stores locations *you* save, locally on your device. Nothing is sent to any server unless you export it yourself.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is this the final version?</h2>
      <p>
        No, this will have continued development for the forseeable future. Though development will be slow as i'm one person and this is a hobby project.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
      <p>
        My wife wanted to know where home always was so I made this so she could always see towards home.
        <br>
        I hope others can use it to always know which way to find home or know the direction towards something they love or a place they find important.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is KroFly intended to be a navigation/survival tool?</h2>
      <p>
        No, please don't use it for that. This is purely for fun and shouldn't be used in that scenario.
        <br>
        It relies on your GPS and sensors calibration, it should show the general direction most of the time, but any navigation should be done with proper equipment.
        <br>
        It's still in a beta phase and as much testing as I do, I'd rather you just be safe. This app is intended for fun and inspiring adventure, reminding you where to find home or point towards something you find important or love.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How can I support the app?</h2>
      <p>Use it, share it, and optionally watch an ad to help fund development. The hope is that it will always be free to use.</p>
