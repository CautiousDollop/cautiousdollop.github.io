    <h1>Privacy Policy for KroFly</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 24/04/2025</p>
    <p>KroFly is a utility app developed by Keegan Connor for Android devices. Your privacy is critically important. This Privacy Policy explains what data KroFly does or does not collect, how it is used, and your rights as a user.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>KroFly does <strong>not collect</strong>, <strong>store</strong>, or <strong>share</strong> any personal or usage data with the developer.</p>
    <p>The app requests access to <strong>precise GPS location</strong> (<code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> and <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code>) for functionality. This data is used <strong>only on-device</strong> to calculate direction and distance toward a selected target when the app is actively in use (foreground). The app does <strong>not</strong> collect or store location data when it is in the background. This location data is <strong>never stored or transmitted</strong> to the developer.</p>
    <p>No analytics, crash reporting, or usage tracking is included in this version of the app.</p>

    <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
    <p>KroFly uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve banner and optional interstitial ads. While KroFly itself does not collect or share data, AdMob may collect limited, non-personally identifiable data to deliver and improve ad performance, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and OS version</li>
        <li>Advertising ID (anonymous identifier)</li>
        <li>IP address (used for regional targeting)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction metrics (e.g., impressions, taps)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data collection is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>You may opt out of personalized ads via your device settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>KroFly is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. The app does not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has used the app and submitted data unintentionally, please contact us, and we will promptly investigate (though no such data should exist).</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>KroFly does not collect or retain any personal or identifiable user data.</p>
    <p>User-saved destinations or favorite locations are stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device only and are not transmitted or accessible by the developer. This local data is removed when you uninstall the app.</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>KroFly may request the following permissions for essential functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Access:</strong> Used solely for compass direction and distance functionality when the app is in use (foreground).</li>
        <li><strong>Foreground Service Location:</strong> Used to allow location functionality while the app runs in the foreground.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> Required only for displaying ads from AdMob.</li>
        <li><strong>Network State:</strong> Used to check the network connection status for proper ad functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreground Service:</strong> Required to keep the app running in the foreground to use GPS location.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No access is requested to your contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or device storage.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy as the app evolves. Updates will be posted on the KroFly website (<a href="https://cautiousdollop.github.io/krofly.html" target="_blank">https://cautiousdollop.github.io/krofly.html</a>). Continued use of KroFly after changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding your privacy, you can contact the developer at:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:cautiousdollop@protonmail.com">cautiousdollop@protonmail.com</a></p>
