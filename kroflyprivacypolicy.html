    <h1>Privacy Policy for KroFly</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 24/04/2025</p>
    <p>KroFly is a utility app developed by Keegan Connor. This app does not collect or store any personal information from users.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>KroFly does not collect, store, or share any personal or usage data.</p>
    <p>The app requests access to <strong>GPS location</strong> to function properly as a directional compass. This data is used <strong>only on-device</strong> to calculate direction and distance and is <strong>never stored or transmitted</strong> by us.</p>

    <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
    <p>KroFly uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve banner advertisements and optional rewarded ads. AdMob may collect limited, non-personal data for the purpose of displaying and improving ads, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type</li>
        <li>Anonymous identifiers (e.g. Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>IP address (used to serve regionally relevant ads)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can learn more about how AdMob handles data in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device’s ad settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>KroFly is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove any such data (though none is knowingly collected).</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or retain any user data.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or on this page. Continued use of the app after changes means you agree to the updated policy.</p>
